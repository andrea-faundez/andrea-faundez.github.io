          <h3>My upbringing</h3>
    
          <p>
            I am the third of five children. I have an older brother and an older sister. I also have a younger sister and a younger brother. 
            My dad is simply a genius. An architect by profession, he is unusually gifted with his hands. He can fix absolutely anything. Cars, 
            washing machines, video cameras, swiss cuckoo clocks, you name it. He is one of those persons that has a look at something, pulls it 
            apart and immediately understands how that thing works. He can also build pretty much anything. The house that my parents live in was 
            built by him in a period of three years over weekends - all of us had to do our bit and help. - Growing up I spent most of my Saturday 
            mornings helping him out. Sometimes my help was just keeping him company, make him laugh. My dad taught me that anything can be fixed/
            built. You just have to figure out what tools and pieces you need.  And if you don't have them, well then you create them.
          </p>

            When I was 9 years old my youngest brother Vicente (Vicho), who was three years old at that time, was diagnosed with autism. The 
            psychiatrist told my parents that if they didn't manage to make Vicho talk before he turned  four, his chances of developing verbal 
            language will drop down to 20%. My mum was  the hero in this story. She dropped everything else and committed herself fully to Vicho's 
            development. Behavioral therapy sessions, card-games, photo collection, songs, story time, role-play, research, speech therapy, hyperbaric 
            oxygen therapy, art therapy, allergy tests, special diets, food supplements, more research, achupulture, Bach flowers, massages, music therapy, 
            chelation therapy, cuddles, tantrums, so many tantrums. Prayers and hope. After almost a year of my mum's persistent non-stop effort, Vicho 
            said his first word: Shampoo. Who would have thought that such a vanal word could bring so much joy and hope. My mum taught me that you don't 
            quit. No matter how hopeless the situation looks. She taught me that no one is going to make things happen for you. It is completely up to you.

            On Sundays we went to church. That is a habit that I carried on with. My children sometimes complain about it. But they know that as long 
            as they live in my home they have no choice. After they leave home it is totally up to them. My faith taught me to find happiness in the midst 
            of adversity. And that the relationships I make during this life are sacred and eternal.
