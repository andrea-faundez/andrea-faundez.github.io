          <h3>My career path way</h3>
    
          <p>
            I want to be a full time developer. I would like to first land a good junior position in a decent sized company so I can 
            perfect and solidify what I have learned at EDA and expand that learning to new horizons. During that time I would like 
            to get some clarity on what area of coding I am best at or enjoy more. Then I would like to land a job in a higher position 
            where I can get experience in a more specialized area of coding and become solid in that area. And from there I don't know. 
            What I do know is that I want to keep up with the constant evolving tools of a developer.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>My strengths concerning learning</h3>

          <p>
            I am very curious, patient and persistent. When I am working on something and I want to accomplish A, I will only settle for B 
            temporarily. I will go to bed and my mind will keep thinking about ways to accomplish A. The next morning I will try every possible 
            way that my mind came up with. I Google a lot and I like to compare different functions to get an understanding of which one will 
            best suit what I am trying to accomplish. In this process I learn a lot of different things and sometimes I learn that actually A is 
            not the best outcome so I end up pivoting to C, D or Z..<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>My limitations concerning learning</h3>

          <p>
            My limitations are that I do not enjoy asking for help. It is something that I haven't had to do much in my life. Usually I figure out 
            things by myself. So asking for help doesn't come naturally to me. That is why I settle temporarily for option B while I find the best 
            way to accomplish A. I only ask for help when I am running out of time.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>A human skill that I lack and long to have</h3>

          <p>
            I would like to be more social. I am capable of interacting well with anyone in a 1-1 setting or even in a small group of 3 - 4 people. 
            But I struggle in large groups. It makes me anxious.<br><br> Maybe it's because I do not like being in the spotlight. Or because I am 
            more of an observer - I love listening to people and understanding their views on a matter. Or maybe it is because English is my second 
            language and in spontaneous settings where the conversation moves fast I can get a bit lost. <br><br> SSmall talk is not my thing. I am 
            terrible at it. So networking at social events is my worst nightmare. It isn't a fear of public speaking, I have no problems doing that. 
            I can address myself to a big audience when I know what I want to communicate and how to communicate it - like at a court hearing, or if 
            I have to give a speech somewhere. 
            .<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload at EDA</h3>

          <p>
            I will go through the material required for each lesson/challenge in time so that when I have to work with other people I have an understanding 
            of what we are doing, what the goal is and some ideas of how to work towards that goal. And also an understanding of the things I don't understand 
            so I can verbalize them and ask for support in those areas.<br><br>  If things build up and start to get to me, I will be honest about it to my 
            team members and facilitator so we can discuss what is the most urgent thing I need to focus on and get done, and what are things that I could catch 
            up on in my spare time.<br><br>  
          </p>

          <h3>My commitment to seeking help on time</h3>

          <p>
            First I will Google the issue. If I don't find the answer in 20 minutes, I will ask my peers. And if they can't help me, then I will ask a facilitator.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>

          <p>
            I expect them to critique my code so I can improve. I also expect them to point me in a direction when I am lost or when there is a better solution I could use.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>My scheduling information during Foundations</h3>

          <p>
            I will be busy with the kids every morning between 8.00am - 9.10am and in the afternoon/evening from 2.20pm till 8.00pm (I pick them-up, do homework, make dinner, 
            play with them and get them ready for bed). Also Sunday mornings and some Saturday afternoons is our family time. .<br><br> 
          </p>
          
          <h3>My scheduling information during the Bootcamp</h3>

          <p>
            My husband will be fully involved with the kids. But I want to be present for them once I get home till their bed time which is at 8.00pm. I will attempt to respect 
            our family time but I understand that it might not always be possible.<br>
