          <h3>My Core Values</h3>
    
          <p>
            According to the Myers Briggs personality Test, I am an Advocate INFJ-T. I guess this combined with my upbringing explains why my 
            core values are <strong>Justice, Compassion, Change,</strong> and <strong>Perseverance</strong>. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <ls>Unbalanced power and inequality just infuriates me, it always has. Something just moves me to point out injustice and to call 
              out for restitution.<br>
            </ls>
            <ls>I believe that people genuinely try their best even though sometimes it might look like they don't.<br></ls>
            <ls>I believe that we are capable of change as individuals and as a rece. I believe that changing our attitudes and our focus can 
              really make a difference in society.<br>
            </ls>
            <ls>I believe anything worthy requires constant work.<br><br></ls>
          </ul>

          <h3>A little story</h3>

          <p>
            It is tough to balance justice and compassion. Me and my siblings are pretty close in age and in friendship. All of us studied very 
            different careers. My older sister is super creative and talented but she is a big procrastinator. The compassion in me made me help 
            her finish her workload till ridiculous hours at night every week. But she kept relying on my help. Her final assignment in her second 
            year of industrial design happened to be the same day of my final civil law exam (an oral exam worth 50%). That day my sense of justice 
            kicked stronger than my sense of compassion. I realized I was enabling her to be irresponsible. The night before her assignment due date, 
            when she asked me for help I told her I couldn't, I had to pepare my own exam. She didn't finish her assignment. She failed her class. 
            BUT, that was the last time she left her assignments to the very last minute. The second time she took that class she made good friends 
            and passed with good grades<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>Culture and Identity</h3>

          <p>
            Coming from a middle class Chilean family that didn't qualify for any government benefit, we learnt to be self-reliant. I guess that my 
            culture has unconsciously made me expect the same drive from everyone else. In my adulthood my sense of compassion has expanded as I got 
            to understand that every person struggles with something and that everyone feels things differently. Mental health is something I only got 
            aware of once I moved to NZ. In Chile you just can't make room for it because people have to provide for their families even when they are 
            ill. Looking back, I now realize that some of my family members and friends weren't lazy, they just had depression and no one knew it - 
            probably not even them. -  Your culture shapes how you perceive others. I am grateful to live in NZ Aotearoa and the kindness of its people.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>

          <p>
            I am relentless. When I put my mind into something I don't stop until I accomplish my goal. I am curious, I love to understand things. I think 
            both of these strengths will be very helpful on this learning journey and in a future career as a developer.<br><br>One of my limitations is 
            time. Although I love to read and research, I have under my care 4 little humans who can't afford to have an absent mother. An strength that 
            can be limiting is my sense of self-reliance which often prevents me to ask for help when I should do it.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Getting over tension</h3>

          <p>
            I can't think of a specific occasion. I have had to take the peacemaker role many times though. What I have learnt is that listening to what 
            someone thinks or wants it is not enough. In most cases they don't know what they really want! - besides being right, obviously. - What will 
            truly point you to the solution is to listen to how people feel and what is making them feel that way.<br><br>
