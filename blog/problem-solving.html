          <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    
          <p>
            OK. This is almost embarrassing but when I was doing the kata built-in methods question three I had a massive mental block. 
            In the instructions in the handbook we were given some short information “find the door number that Scooby is hiding behind.” 
            And then the following hint: you may want to use console.log.” Consolo.log what? .<br>
          </p>


          <p>
            Maybe my brain was extra tired but I just did not process the hint. Instead I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to 
            figure out how the information given was organized in order to know how to access that information. Is <em>door</em> an array? 
            <em>Scooby</em> a value in the array? Scooby's door number the index position? Or is <em>door</em> an object with different 
            "door number" properties, "Scooby" being the value of one of those door numbers? Or is <em>door</em> also a property? WHAT 
            ARE YOU DOOR?! I wrote down different objects and arrays trying to visualize the information. Then I  wrote functions aiming 
            to access the information I had organized. But it was pointless; it was like throwing darts in the dark. I finally got over 
            my fear of asking for help and I left a question in discord.<br> 
          </p>

          <p>
            It was lunchtime so I didn't wait for an answer, I decided to reach out to a classmate. The first thing he did was to console.log 
            the unknown array! He also explained a few other things about function structure which were quite helpful. When we finished our 
            call I checked Discord again and one of the facilitator had replied to my comment: “hey this exercise is suuuper confusing at 
            first, but try using console.log(arr) to see what your data looks like!” Yes, that was the key to solving the problem, having 
            the right information. In this case that was knowing I had two empty arrays and three arrays with objects inside them, 1, 2 
            and 3 objects respectively. And <em>door</em> was neither an array or an object but the key of a property. And <em>Scooby</em> 
            the value of the second property whose key was <em>hiding</em>.<br> 
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lessons learnt:</strong> you need the right information to get somewhere. If you don't have it or you do but you don't 
            understand it, then ask questions. In my experience there is always someone that knows more than you do.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>

          <p>
            Learning about built-in methods was eye opening because before I thought that I had to write every single function from scratch. 
            Now I realized that there are lots of methods that have a function intrinsic to them. Knowing some of these methods is a game 
            changer. For example after I had finished solving the FizzBuzz challenge I read about maps while working on the built-in method 
            challenge. I went back to the super_fizzbuzz function and I commented out my original answer that had 8 lines of code, by the way,  
            and I wrote a function with a map method calling the function fizzbuzz to my newly created array. The whole thing was half the 
            length of my original answer. So much easier to read and understand.<br>  
          </p>

          <p>
            When solving the kata challenges I used a lot of pseudo coding. I found it really helpful to structure the steps in my functions. 
            Then it was easier to google solutions because my search could be very specific related to a specific step instead of the whole 
            function. Most of the time that narrow search would lead me to discover a new handy method.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lesson learnt:</strong> programming languages keep evolving and expanding. New keywords and methods keep being created. 
            Learn them. They will make your life easier.<br><br>

          <h3>My scheduling information during Foundations</h3>

          <p>
            I will be busy with the kids every morning between 8.00am - 9.10am and in the afternoon/evening from 2.20pm till 8.00pm (I pick them-up, do homework, make dinner, 
            play with them and get them ready for bed). Also Sunday mornings and some Saturday afternoons is our family time. .<br><br> 
          </p>
