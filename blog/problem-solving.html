          <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    
          <p>
            OK. This is almost embarrassing but when I was doing the kata built-in methods - question three - I had a massive mental block. 
            In the instructions in the handbook we were given some short information “find the door number that Scooby is hiding behind.” 
            And then the following hint: you may want to use console.log.” Console.log what? <br>
          </p>

          <p>
            Maybe my brain was extra tired but I just didn't process the hint. Instead, I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to 
            figure out how the given information was organised in order to know how to access that information. Was <em>door</em> an 
            array and Scooby a value in this array? Was <em>Scooby's door number</em> the index position? Or was <em>door</em>  an object 
            with different <em>door number</em> properties, Scooby being the value of one of those door numbers? Or was <em>door</em> also 
            a property? WHAT ARE YOU DOOR?! I wrote down different objects and arrays trying to visualise the information. Then I wrote 
            functions aiming to access the information I had organised. But it was pointless; it was like throwing darts in the dark. 
            I finally got over my fear of asking for help and I left a question on Discord.<br> 
          </p>

          <p>
            It was lunchtime so I didn't wait for an answer and decided to reach out to a classmate. The first thing he did was to console.log 
            the unknown array! He also explained a few other things about function structure which were quite helpful. When we finished our call 
            I checked Discord again. One of the facilitators had replied to my comment: “hey this exercise is suuuper confusing at first'', he 
            said, "but try using console.log(arr) to see what your data looks like!” Yes, that was the key to solving the problem, having the 
            right information. In this case that was knowing I had two empty arrays and three arrays with objects inside them. And <em>door</em> 
            was neither an array nor an object but the key of a property whose value was the <em>door number</em>. And <em>Scooby</em> the value 
            of the second property whose key was <em>hiding</em>.<br> 
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lessons learnt:</strong> you need the right information to get somewhere. If you don't have it, or you do have it but you don't 
            understand it, then ask questions. There is always someone that knows something that you don't.<br><br>

          <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>

          <p>
            Learning about built-in methods was eye opening because before this I thought that I had to write every single function from scratch. 
            Now I realise that there are lots of methods that have a function intrinsic to them. Knowing some of these methods is a game changer. 
            For example, after I had finished solving the FizzBuzz challenge, I read about maps while working on the built-in method challenge. 
            I went back to the super_fizzbuzz function and I commented out my original answer (that had 8 lines of code, BTW),  and I wrote a 
            function with a map method calling the function fizzbuzz to my newly created array. The whole thing was half the length of my original 
            answer. So much easier to read and understand.<br>  
          </p>

          <p>
            When solving the kata challenges I used a lot of pseudo coding. I found it really helpful to structure the steps in my functions. Then 
            it was easier to Google solutions because my search could be narrowed in relation to a specific step of the function instead of the whole 
            function. Most of the time that narrow search would lead me to discover a new handy method.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lesson learnt:</strong> Programming languages keep evolving and expanding. New keywords and methods keep being created. Keep up 
            with them. Discover them. Learn them. They will make your life easier.<br><br>
