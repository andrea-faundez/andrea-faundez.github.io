          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

          <ul>
            <ls>
              I learnt that my willpower is stronger than I thought. During sprint two and three my kids had their school break. If I wanted to 
              get any quality study time I had to get it done when the kids were in bed. My brain gets tired at night so I decided I was going 
              to wake up early instead and get as much done during the morning. 4.00am was my usual wakeup time during those two weeks and that 
              habit stuck for the rest of foundations.<br><br>
            </ls>
            <ls>
              I am too proud to recognise I need to ask for help. My husband sent me the following meme yesterday (I think that sums it quite 
              well!)<br>
              <img class="smaller-image" src="https://andrea-faundez.github.io/img/WhatsApp Image 2022-05-12 at 8.49.36 PM.jpeg"><br><br><br>
            </ls>
            <ls>
              I learned that getting a clown to change his clothes is way more exciting than going to the movies. I don't know what that says about me. 
            </ls><br>
          </ul>
    
          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

          <p>
            In terms of learning, I think that empathy for yourself and others takes away the awkwardness of not knowing what you are doing and also makes 
            you more prompt to help others to understand something when they reach out for help. Self awareness about what you think of yourself affects 
            your self-confidence and your self-confidence affects your learning. And in terms of programming, I think that having a team culture that 
            embraces open, clear, honest, constructive communication will improve any working relationships and any project you're working on as a team.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

          <p>
            How soothing it was to my soul. I think foundations would have been a lot harder without the core material that gave us the tools to deal with 
            the hardship of the technical part.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

          <p>
            Being vulnerable. In every role I have had to fulfill in my life I have always been required to show a brave face. No room to be tired, scared, 
            lost. Having to write about my struggles and then share them with a group of strangers was challenging. At times cathartic even.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

          <p>
            Because you are good people that care about our wellbeing! I think you are trying to ensure that we will be an awesome addition to any team of 
            programmers that we join in the future. You are preparing us to deal with stress, to learn more effectively, to stick to timelines, and to 
            navigate other people's emotions and mental structures, to understand and communicate our own needs.<br><br>  
          </p>

          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming 
            instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Not at all. I meditate every day now! I am careful with the narratives I tell myself. I am learning something harder than law and I am enjoying 
            it and that is all possible because of the core curriculum. I do wish I had had more time to learn Javascript perhaps at a slower rate but I 
            think that is on me, I should have prepared better before starting foundations.<br><br>
