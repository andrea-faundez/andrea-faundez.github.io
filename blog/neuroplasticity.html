          <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
    
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior. Neuroscientists used to think that the 
            brain stopped developing in adolescence. We now know that the brain is malleable. This means that the brain is capable of adaptive 
            change. Thus a person's ability to learn is not static. It can improve - or decrease -  over time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is such a transforming and empowering notion. Because it makes the hope of equality possible. It means intelligence 
            is not determined at birth but is a journey that you are never to late to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding neuroplasticity changes our attitude towards learning. Challenges become opportunities to grow and expand instead of 
            moments of frustration and humiliation. We seek challenges and embrace them. The “what is the point” attitude is replaced with “OK I 
            will give myself the opportunity to learn as much as I can from this”. Our attitude towards something really affects our ability to 
            learn that thing. So having the right attitude is key to learning. 
          </p>
          <p>
            American psychologist Carol Dweck in her Ted Talk <a target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-swZaKN2Ic">“The Power of Yet”</a>, 
            explains how neuroplasticity works and how we can implement its principle in schools. She explains that rewarding results is part of the 
            tyranny of “now”. A “Fail” grade means that right now you don't have what it takes. In other words, right now you are not enough. That is 
            why getting an F affects anyone's self-esteem. It makes you feel small, dumb, lost. But if you were to receive a “no yet” grade, instead of an 
            F, your learning experience would be put into context: you are not there <strong>yet</strong> but you are on your path to get there. A "not yet" 
            leaves the door open to the future, it points you towards the necessary steps that will take you to achieving your goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dweck asks “How are we raising our children? Are we raising them for now instead of yet? Are we raising kids that are obsessed with getting As? 
            Are we raising kids that don't know how to dream big dreams? Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score? And are they carrying 
            this need of constant validation with them into their future lives?<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>How can I engage with these principles for my own benefit</h3>

          <p>
            My whole life I have been resistant to try new activities because of my inner fear of not not getting it right immediately and looking dumb in 
            front of others. Things that are meant to be recreational like bowling or minigolf or go-karting, can become a source of stress to me. How silly. 
            Why would anyone expect me to get those activities - or any activity for that matter - right on the first go? And what does it mean if I do an awful 
            job the first five times I try something new? It doesn't say anything about me. It only signals where I'm at in my learning curve.  What a soothing 
            concept.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Some of the ways you can increase your neuroplasticity</h3>

          <p>
            The best way to increase neuroplasticity is by exposing your brain to new things. This could mean trying to learn a new skill (like learning to play 
            an instrument, or learning to paint). But you can do even simpler things like visiting new places, or changing the route to your usual locations. 
            This forces your brain to create new connections, new bridges. The same happens when you expose yourself to different music. Another way is by practicing 
            mindfulness. Intentionally journaling is also a great exercise and so is brain aerobics (using your alternate hand to do everyday activities like brushing 
            your teeth or writing, or doing these activities while keeping your eyes closed).
          </p>
          <p>If you want to improve your mindfulness practice, give some of these <a target="_self" href="https://insighttimer.com/">meditations</a> a go.</p>
          <p>Do you want to journal but you don't know how to start? Give the <a target="blank" href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/three-good-things" >Three Good Things</a> a go.</p><br>

          <h3>Growth Mindste. Why is it relevant?</h3>

          <p>
            A grwoth mindset is a consequence of understanding neuroplasticity. It happens when we understand that our abiities can be developed. Dweck said "In a 
            growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. 
            This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. ...In the fixed mindset, everything is about the outcome. 
            If you fail—or if you're not the best—it's all been wasted. The growth mindset allows people to value what they're doing regardless of the outcome. They're tackling 
            problems, charting new courses, working on important issues. Maybe they haven't found the cure for cancer, but the search was deeply meaningful. ...When 
            nurturing growth mindsets, it's important to acknowledge effort, but praise improvement." 
          </p>
          
          <p>In short a growth mindset makes the process of learning enjoyable, rewarding and effective.</p><br>

          <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>

          <p>
            Realizing how I have limited my ability to enjoy new experiences because of my fear of looking dumb was super enlightening. I realize now that these fears have little 
            to do with shyness but are more of a consequence of  growing up in a school system that praised results. Maybe I would be a different person if I had attended a school 
            with a “not yet” mentality, that praises improvement regardless of the starting point.<br><br>This realization has prompted me to be more careful when I praise my own 
            children. I've always wanted them to grow up with no fear of ridicule and failure but I wasn't quite sure how to ensure that. This exploration gave me some awesome tools 
            that I can't wat to put into practice.
          </p><br>

          <h3>How will you integrate “growth mindset” into your learning journey?</h3>

          <p>
            Good question. I think I will be more compassionate towards myself. And I will work on my self-belief (or self-efficacy). Self-efficacy is a person's belief in their ability 
            to complete tasks and to achieve their goals (Bandura, 1995). Judging yourself to be capable of success increases your chances of actual success. Judging yourself as not 
            capable of success reduces the chance of success. A healthy balance between your confidence to undergo something, and your notion of what your strengths and weaknesses are 
            will allow you to focus on how to overcome your weaknesses.
