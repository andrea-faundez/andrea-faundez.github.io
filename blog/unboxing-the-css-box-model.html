      <h2 class="h2">Unboxing the CSS Box Model</h2>
    </header>

    <main  class="p">
      <p>
        When laying out a page, the browser represents each element as a box with different areas, thus “the css box model”. 
        These areas determine the space surrounding each element and how that space interacts with other elements in your page. 
        Every HTML element has four areas: content, padding, border and margin. The  image below illustrates the areas in the 
        css box model:<br><br>
      </p>

      <img class="bigger-image" src="../img/css-box.jpg" alt="css box model drawing"><br><br>
      
      <p>Let's have a look at each area of the model:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <ls><span style="text-decoration: underline";>Content:</span> The content area is the element itself (text, image, video player). Its dimensions 
          are defined by the element's width and height. These dimensions are given by default but they can be customized 
          with the widths and high properties.<br><br></ls>

          <ls><span style="text-decoration: underline";>Padding:</span> An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border. The CSS 
          padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. Padding 
          values are set using lengths, percentages, or the inherited keyword. Padding cannot accept negative values. The 
          initial, or default, value for all padding properties is 0.<br>

          <br>The values can be set by the padding-top, padding-right, padding-left and padding-bottom properties or by the 
          shorthand padding property. When using the shorthand padding property you can specify one, two, three or four values.<br><br>

           <ol>
            <ls>- One value: sets the same padding in all 4 directions (top, right, bottom and left)<br></ls>
            <ls>- Two values: the first value sets the top and bottom padding, and the second value sets the right and left.<br></ls>
            <ls>- Three values: first one for top, second ones for right and left, and the third one for bottom.<br></ls>
            <ls>- Four values: the values represent the top, right, left and bottom padding.<br><br></ls>
           </ol>

           <br>Padding can be used to make an element grow or shrink. Here is an example of how padding affects the content's size:<br><br>

           <img class="bigger-image" src="../img/padding-eg.jpg" alt="examples of padding extending the element"><br><br>
           
           A word of warning, without a background color and a border it is quite difficult to notice the padding in action. You just will see your piece of text moving 
           up and down or from side to side, almost as if you were adjusting the margin instead.<br><br>
        </ls>

        <ls><span style="text-decoration: underline";>Border:</span> The border is the limit between the padding and the margin. It can be made explicit to enhance
          an element by styling the border in a certain way, changing its color, thickness and style (solid, dotted, dashed, double, 
          groove, ridge, inset, outset, none or hidden).<br><br>
        </ls>

        <ls><span style="text-decoration: underline";>Margin:</span> The margin property defines the outermost portion (area) of the box model, creating space around 
          an element, outside of any defined borders. The margin property is used to separate an element from its neighbor elements. 
          The size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and shorthand margin 
          properties. Margins are set using lengths, percentages, or the keyword auto and can have negative values.
        </ls>
      </ul>
    
      <p>A good way to think about these areas and how they interact with each other, is to imagine you are decorating a wall (your page) with photographs (your content). 
        You could place a mat (padding) behind  a photo,  you can frame (border) another photo, and you can put them in different locations (margin) relating to each other 
        and the wall. Here are a few examples:
      </p><br>

      <section id="photo-gallery">
        <div id=photo-1>
          <img class="long-image" src="../img/padding-situations.png" alt="three photo frames with different mats">
        </div>

        <div id="photo-2">
          <img class="long-image" style="width: 32vw;" src="../img/border-situation.png" alt="three photo with different frames">
        </div>

        <div id="text-1" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-top: -10%">
          <p>
            <br>The mat represents the padding. You can<br> 
            choose to leave your padding at its starting<br>
            point, which is 0px like in the last photo.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="text-2" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-top: -10%;">
          <p>
            <br>The frame represents the border. You can <br>
            frame your picture in any way you like.<br> 
            No frame is also an option.<br>
          </p> 
        </div>

        <div id="photo-3">
          <img class="medium-image" style="width: 42vw;" src="../img/margin-1.png" alt="4 photo frames with the same argin">
        </div>

        <div>
          <img class="medium-image" src="../img/margin-2.png" alt="4 photo frames with different margins from each other">
        </div>

        <div id="text-3" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: -5%;">
          <p>The photo frames have the same<br>distance between them.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="text-4" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: -5%;">
          <p>By changing the margins the frame<br>change position within the wall.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <p style="margin-top: -7%;">I hope this was useful!<br><br><br><br></p>
