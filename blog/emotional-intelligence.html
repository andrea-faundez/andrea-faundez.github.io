          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence or EQ (Emotional Quotient) is defined by Salovey and Mayer as <em>"the ability to monitor one's own and other 
            people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide 
            thinking and behavior"</em> Emotional intelligence is a skill that can be improved through regular practice. 
          </p>
          <p>EQ encompasses abilities like:</p>

          <ul>
            <ls><strong>Perceiving emotions</strong> - the ability to read or identify emotions in others (through their facial expressions, voice 
              tone, posture, etc.) and in one's self (recognising our body signs and feelings). Perceiving emotions is the doorway to EQ.<br><br>
            </ls>
            <ls><strong>Using emotions</strong> - the ability to harness emotions that can help undertake a task.<br><br>
            </ls>
            <ls><strong>Understanding emotions</strong> - the ability to understand how an emotion is created, evolves, interacts with other emotions 
              and how they influence each other.<br><br>
            </ls>
            <ls><strong>Managing emotions</strong> - the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others.<br><br><br>
            </ls>
          </ul>

          <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

          <p>
            IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is the ability to learn, understand process and apply information. IQ is measured through other abilities like 
            logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking, and filtering irrelevant information. IQ is used to 
            determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenge.<br><br> 
          </p>

          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

          <p>
            EQ is such a powerful tool that can improve different areas of your life. You can improve your relationship with yourself by being aware of 
            your needs. It can help you endure adversity. It helps us to deal with conflict and recognise valuable criticism.You can develop healthy 
            relationships with family and friends. It can make your life at work easier. It can boost your career. And all of these improvements count 
            for a happier healthier life, an optimal life.
